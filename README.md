## 📁 Part 1 Submission: Laying the Foundation

In this phase, I focused on establishing the core structure of the website using HTML. The goal was to create a clean, semantic layout that could be easily expanded upon in future iterations.

### ✅ Key Features Implemented

- 🏗️ **Basic HTML Skeleton**  
  Set up the essential `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to define the document structure.

- 🖼️ **Image Components**  
  Incorporated relevant images using `<img>` tags to enhance visual engagement.

- 🔗 **Anchor Tags**  
  Added basic navigation links with `<a>` tags to connect internal sections and external resources.

- 📝 **Paragraph Tags**  
  Used `<p>` elements to structure readable content and provide descriptive text.

- 📌 **Headings and Lists**  
  Introduced `<h1>` to `<h3>` tags and unordered lists (`<ul>`) for better content organization.

- 🎨 **Minimal Inline Styling**  
  Applied basic inline styles to test visual changes and layout behavior.

## 📁 Part 2 Submission: Styling and Refinement

Building on the foundation from Part 1, this phase focused on enhancing the user experience and visual appeal through CSS and improved layout techniques.

### ✅ Key Enhancements Made

- 🎨 **CSS Integration**  
  Linked an external stylesheet to separate design from structure and streamline styling.

- 🧭 **Navigation Overhaul**  
  Refined the navigation bar for better usability and aesthetic consistency.

- 📐 **Positioning Elements with CSS**  
  Used Flexbox and other positioning techniques to align content and create a responsive layout.

- 🖌️ **Typography and Color Scheme**  
  Selected fonts and color palettes to improve readability and visual harmony.

- 📱 **Responsive Design Tweaks**  
  Ensured the site adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and devices.

- 🧹 **Code Cleanup and Semantic Improvements**  
  Replaced generic tags with semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
